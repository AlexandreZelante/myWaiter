# myWaiter

Self-service restaurant system developed in ASP.NET in C# using WebForms and some MVC concepts. 

This is a work I did in 2015 when I was 17 years old in my technical course. It was developed from scratch in ASP.NET in C # using WebForms and some MVC concepts.

It's a self-service system, in which customers make their own order using a tablet. The information is sent to a screen in the kitchen.

Functionalities: Occupation of desks, individual registers, administrative area of product registration, finalization of account.
